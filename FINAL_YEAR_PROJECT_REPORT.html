        <!-- ABSTRACT -->
        <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
        <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of the gig economy and small-medium enterprises (SMEs), efficient financial management is paramount. Traditional methods of invoicing—relying on paper trails, spreadsheets, or disjointed tools—often lead to errors, delayed payments, and poor record-keeping. <strong>Accountill</strong> is a modern, full-stack web application designed to solve these problems by providing a centralized platform for invoicing and client management.</p>
        <p>Developed using the <strong>MERN Stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), Accountill offers a robust solution for freelancers and business owners. The application features a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Google OAuth, ensuring user data privacy. Core functionalities include the creation, management, and tracking of professional invoices, receipts, estimates, and quotations. Users can customize documents, manage client databases, and visualize financial health through an interactive dashboard powered by Apex Charts.</p>
        <p>Key innovations in this project include an automated PDF generation engine using <code>html-pdf</code>, a seamless email delivery system via Nodemailer for sending invoices directly to clients, and a real-time payment tracking system that updates invoice statuses automatically. This report documents the entire software development lifecycle of Accountill, from requirements elicitation and system design to implementation and testing, demonstrating a scalable architecture suitable for real-world deployment.</p>

        <!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
        <h2>CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>The digital transformation of business processes has revolutionized how organizations operate. Among these processes, financial management—specifically invoicing and billing—remains a critical function for any specific business entity. <strong>Accountill</strong> is a web-based application developed to streamline these operations. It leverages modern web technologies to provide a seamless, responsive, and secure platform for managing invoices.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2 Background of the Study</h3>
        <p>Freelancers and Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) often struggle with administrative overheads. According to recent surveys, freelancers spend a significant portion of their non-billable time on administrative tasks, including creating invoices, following up on payments, and organizing client details. While large enterprises have access to expensive ERP solutions like SAP or Oracle, these are often cost-prohibitive and overly complex for smaller entities.</p>
        
        <h3>1.3 Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>The current landscape of invoicing for small businesses faces several challenges:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Manual Errors:</strong> Using generic tools like Microsoft Word or Excel leads to calculation errors in taxes, discounts, and totals.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Centralization:</strong> Client details, past invoices, and payment records are often scattered across different files and folders.</li>
            <li><strong>Inefficiency:</strong> Manually converting documents to PDF and emailing them is time-consuming.</li>
            <li><strong>Poor Analytics:</strong> Without a dedicated system, tracking outstanding payments and monthly revenue becomes difficult.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.4 Objectives of the Project</h3>
        <p>The primary goal of Accountill is to democratize access to professional financial tools.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Develop:</strong> A full-stack web application capable of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for invoices and clients.</li>
            <li><strong>To Automate:</strong> The calculation of sub-totals, VAT, and grand totals to eliminate human error.</li>
            <li><strong>To Secure:</strong> Implement robust authentication to ensure that a user's financial data is private and inaccessible to others.</li>
            <li><strong>To Integrate:</strong> Email services and PDF generation to streamline the delivery of invoices.</li>
            <li><strong>To Visualize:</strong> Provide a dashboard that summarizes financial data into actionable insights (e.g., Total Paid vs. Unpaid).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.5 Scope of the Project</h3>
        <p><strong>In-Scope:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>User Registration and Authentication (Local & Google OAuth).</li>
            <li>Profile Management (Logo, Address, Contact Info).</li>
            <li>Client Management (Add, Edit, Delete Clients).</li>
            <li>Invoice Management (Create, Edit, Delete, Duplicate).</li>
            <li>PDF Download and Email functionality.</li>
            <li>Payment History Logging.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Out-of-Scope:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integration with live payment gateways (Stripe/PayPal) for real-time credit card processing (planned for future).</li>
            <li>Multi-currency automatic conversion rates (currently manual).</li>
            <li>Inventory management.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <!-- CHAPTER 2 -->
        <h2>CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 Overview of the MERN Stack</h3>
        <p>The MERN stack is a JavaScript-based software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications. It consists of four key technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> A document-oriented NoSQL database used to store application data. Unlike SQL databases, it uses flexible documents instead of rigid tables.</li>
            <li><strong>Express.js:</strong> A web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust APIs and handling HTTP requests.</li>
            <li><strong>React:</strong> A frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Maintained by Facebook, it allows for the creation of reusable UI components.</li>
            <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Comparison with Other Stacks</h3>
        <p><strong>MERN vs. LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP):</strong> LAMP has been the standard for decades. However, MERN offers a unified language (JavaScript) for both client and server, leading to better developer productivity and code reuse. MongoDB's JSON-like structure maps directly to frontend objects, eliminating the need for complex ORMs required in SQL-based LAMP stacks.</p>
        <p><strong>MERN vs. MEAN (Angular instead of React):</strong> While similar, React offers a steeper learning curve but greater flexibility and a larger ecosystem compared to Angular's opinionated structure. React's Virtual DOM also provides superior performance for dynamic applications.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Review of Existing Systems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zoho Invoice:</strong> A powerful commercial tool. <em>Limitation:</em> The free tier is very restrictive, and the UI can be overwhelming for simple needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Wave Apps:</strong> A free accounting tool. <em>Limitation:</em> It has started restricting features in certain regions and often pushes paid payroll services.</li>
            <li><strong>Excel/Word Templates:</strong> The most common competitor. <em>Limitation:</em> Static, error-prone, no database, no analytics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Accountill</strong> aims to bridge the gap by offering the simplicity of a template with the power of a database-backed application, without the cost or complexity of enterprise software.</p>

        </ul>
        
        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <!-- CHAPTER 4 -->
        <h2>CHAPTER 4: SYSTEM DESIGN</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 System Architecture</h3>
        <p>The application uses a <strong>RESTful Client-Server Architecture</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client (Frontend):</strong> React.js Single Page Application (SPA). It handles the presentation layer and state management using Redux.</li>
            <li><strong>Server (Backend):</strong> Express.js / Node.js. It serves as the API layer, handling logic, validation, and database communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Database:</strong> MongoDB Atlas (Cloud). It stores all persistent data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Database Design</h3>
        <p>The database consists of three primary collections. Below is the schema design.</p>

        <h4>4.2.1 User Collection</h4>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Field</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>_id</td><td>ObjectId</td><td>Unique Identifier</td></tr>
            <tr><td>name</td><td>String</td><td>Full Name of the user</td></tr>
            <tr><td>email</td><td>String</td><td>Unique email address</td></tr>
            <tr><td>password</td><td>String</td><td>Bcrypt hashed password</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h4>4.2.2 Client Collection</h4>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Field</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>_id</td><td>ObjectId</td><td>Unique Identifier</td></tr>
            <tr><td>name</td><td>String</td><td>Client Name</td></tr>
            <tr><td>email</td><td>String</td><td>Client Email</td></tr>
            <tr><td>phone</td><td>String</td><td>Contact Number</td></tr>
            <tr><td>userId</td><td>[String]</td><td>ID of the user who owns this client</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h4>4.2.3 Invoice Collection</h4>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Field</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>invoiceNumber</td><td>String</td><td>Custom invoice identifier</td></tr>
            <tr><td>client</td><td>Object</td><td>Embedded object with client snapshot</td></tr>
            <tr><td>items</td><td>Array</td><td>List of items {name, price, qty}</td></tr>
            <tr><td>total</td><td>Number</td><td>Grand total amount</td></tr>
            <tr><td>status</td><td>String</td><td>'Paid', 'Unpaid', 'Partial'</td></tr>
        </table>
        
        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <!-- CHAPTER 5 -->
        <h2>CHAPTER 5: IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 Technology Stack Details</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React 17, Redux (Thunk), Axios, Moment.js.</li>
            <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node 14+, Express 4, Mongoose 5.</li>
            <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> <code>nodemailer</code> for emails, <code>html-pdf</code> for document generation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Backend Implementation Example</h3>
        <p>Authentication Controller Snippet:</p>
<pre>    
// Excerpt from user controller
export const signin = async (req, res) => {
    const { email, password } = req.body;
    try {
        const existingUser = await User.findOne({ email });
        if(!existingUser) return res.status(404).json({ message: "User doesn't exist." });

        const isPasswordCorrect = await bcrypt.compare(password, existingUser.password);
        if(!isPasswordCorrect) return res.status(400).json({ message: "Invalid credentials." });

        const token = jwt.sign({ email: existingUser.email, id: existingUser._id }, process.env.SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });
        res.status(200).json({ result: existingUser, token });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: "Something went wrong." });
    }
}
</pre>

        <h3>5.3 Frontend State Management</h3>
        <p>Redux Action Creator Example:</p>
<pre>
export const createInvoice = (invoice, history) => async (dispatch) => {
    try {
        dispatch({ type: START_LOADING })
        const { data } = await api.addInvoice(invoice)
        dispatch({ type: ADD_NEW, payload: data })
        history.push(`/invoice/${data._id}`)
        dispatch({ type: END_LOADING })
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error)
    }
}
</pre>

        <h3>5.4 PDF Generation Logic</h3>
        <p>The PDF feature is unique. Instead of generating it on the client, the server handles it.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Frontend sends invoice data to <code>/invoices</code>.</li>
            <li>Backend passes this data into an HTML template literal function.</li>
            <li><code>html-pdf</code> converts this HTML string into a binary PDF buffer.</li>
            <li>The PDF is either saved to a file or piped directly to the response.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- CHAPTER 7 -->
        <h2>CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION</h2>
        
        <h3>7.1 Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Accountill</strong> project successfully demonstrates the power and flexibility of the MERN stack. We have built a fully functional invoicing application that addresses real-world business problems. The system allows users to securely manage their clients, generate professional financial documents, and track their earnings.</p>

        <h3>7.2 Challenges Faced</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Handling complex state updates for nested invoice items was challenging. Redux proved essential but required significant boilerplate code.</li>
            <li><strong>PDF Formatting:</strong> Designing HTML that converts perfectly to A4 PDF required trial and error with CSS print styles.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Implementing Google OAuth alongside local authentication required careful handling of JWT tokens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.3 Future Enhancements</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Payment Gateway Integration:</strong> Adding Stripe/PayPal to allow clients to pay invoices directly via a link.</li>
            <li><strong>Recurring Invoices:</strong> Automating invoices for subscription-based services.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-User Teams:</strong> Allowing multiple users to manage a single company account.</li>
        </ol>
